There I was standing in front of a stainless steel table, belongings strewn about, a sweater spilling out of my half-unzipped duffel bag. A stranger was rummaging through my stuff. I had no shoes on. I had arrived three hours early — probably too early — mostly out of anxiety surrounding the unpredictability of moments like this.
Then the airport security agent pulled a small jar of honey from my bag, as if it were an emerald excavated from an ancient tomb in some long-forgotten jungle."><meta name=author content="tjards"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/density_of_honey/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/img/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/img/favicon16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/img/favicon32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/density_of_honey/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/density_of_honey/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="research notes"><meta property="og:title" content="The Density of Honey"><meta property="og:description" content="A small story about the density of honey at airports.
