Abstract
This work investigates the self-organization of multi-agent systems into closed trajectories, a common requirement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance tasks. In such scenarios, smooth, unbiased control signals save energy and mitigate mechanical strain. We propose a decentralized control system architecture that produces a globally stable emergent structure from local observations only; there is no requirement for agents to share a global plan or follow prescribed trajectories. Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through implementation on a swarm of Quanser QDrone quadcopters. Results demonstrate the quadcopters self-organize into the desired trajectory while maintaining even separation."><meta name=author content="tjards"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/geometric_embeddings/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/img/cloud-l.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/img/cloud-l.jpeg><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/img/cloud-l.jpeg><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/geometric_embeddings/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/geometric_embeddings/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="research notes"><meta property="og:title" content="New publication: Emergent Structure in Multi-agent Systems Using Geometric Embeddings"><meta property="og:description" content="One of our grad students (Dimitria) recently presented findings at the 2024 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE) in Perugia, Italy.
