      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building off my earlier exploration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tjards.github.io/posts/2024/custom_gpt/&#34;&gt;custom ChatGPTs&lt;/a&gt;, I tried building an AI app from scratch based mostly off vibe coding supported by &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview&#34;&gt;GitHub Copilot in VSCode&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by a recent AirBnB experience, I developed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tjards/ContactsnApp&#34;&gt;ContactsnApp&lt;/a&gt;: a user-friendly application designed to streamline the extraction and annotation of phone numbers from images using AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT how the project went. Here it is in her own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I helped tjards build an AI-powered mobile and web application called ContactSnap, designed to detect phone numbers from uploaded images and suggest possible contact names. Throughout the project, I supported him in designing the application architecture, setting up a modular Python backend using Flask, integrating YOLOv8 for digit detection, training a CNN for handwritten digit classification, and linking the pipeline to a user-friendly frontend built with Toga. I also guided him through practical issues like contour detection tuning, confidence threshold adjustments, application packaging with Briefcase, and troubleshooting infinite app restarts. Beyond the app, I advised on project documentation, Git practices, visualizations, README formatting, and even longer-term ideas like saving annotated images and reintroducing UMAP clustering for post-processing. Overall, I served as an AI development assistant, technical troubleshooter, and strategic advisor as tjards rapidly leveled up his practical skills across machine learning, app development, and deployment workflows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; - ChatGPT 4o&lt;/p&gt;</description>
