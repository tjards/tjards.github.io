I am a scientific researcher and Adjunct Assistant Professor with the School of Computing at Queen's University in Canada and early member of the [Autonomous Robotics Research Group](https://labs.cs.queensu.ca/quarrg/).

 My [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/1974/24245) investigated the use of reinforcement learning to improve the performance of model predictive control in ground and aerial vehicles applications. My current work focuses mainly on control and learning in multi-agent robotics applications.
