I am an Adjunct Assistant Professor with the School of Computing at Queen's University in Canada and early member of the [Autonomous Robotics Research Group](https://labs.cs.queensu.ca/quarrg/).

 My [early research](http://hdl.handle.net/1974/24245) investigated the use of reinforcement learning to improve the performance of model predictive control in ground and aerial vehicle applications. My [current work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2025.112221) focuses primarily on learning and control in multi-agent robotics applications. 

A full list of my publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RGlv4ZUAAAAJ&hl=en).

### student supervision 

I am currently supervising graduate students at the Master's and PhD levels and am open to discussing new opportunities. If you are interested, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:p.jardine@queensu.ca">email</a> and we can set up time to chat.
