One of our grad students (Dimitria) recent presented new work at the [2024 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE)](https://2024.ieeeisse.org/) in Perugia, Italy. This new work builds off some of our earlier investigations into [emergent leminscate traectories](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9931405) by providing a more general solution, applicable to a wide range of closed-curve trajectories. 

Abstract:
*This work investigates the self-organization of multi-agent systems into closed trajectories, a common requirement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance tasks. In such scenarios, smooth, unbiased control signals save energy and mitigate mechanical strain. We propose a decentralized control system architecture that produces a globally stable emergent structure from local observations only; there is no requirement for agents to share a global plan or follow prescribed trajectories. Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through implementation on a swarm of Quanser QDrone quadcopters. Results demonstrate the quadcopters self-organize into the desired trajectory while maintaining even separation.*
