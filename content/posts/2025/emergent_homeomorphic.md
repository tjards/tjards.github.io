## Emergent homeomorphic curves in swarms

This work introduces the concept of geometric embeddings, which permit the application of linear control policies to produce globally-stable emergent curves in swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. The vehicles make decisions based only on local observations, without knowing their role in the larger group. Below is an animation of the technique being used to produce a lemniscatic arc.
