a bridge collapsed in Baltimore today <br>
the guy on the radio is blaming the president <br>
was he driving the boat?<br>
I think it was that guy’s fault <br>
the guy driving the boat <br>
why did all the victims have names from other places?<br>

across the world they’re making people fight<br>
i don’t really know what orthodox means<br>
you mean they didn’t have to before?<br>

the previous president is selling bibles<br>
to pay for his bail<br>
because he paid a prostitute <br>
and said he was a billionaire <br>
but a millionaire for tax purposes <br>
then became president for a while <br>
and now he wants to be again<br>

it’s unusually warm this winter <br>
apparently the ice caps are melting <br>
why is this not a big deal? <br>
apparently people say they’re not melting <br>
even though the ice is water now<br>

weed is legal <br>
mushrooms are next<br>
is anyone else worried they want us to avoid our problems?<br>

I can’t afford a house<br>
actually, I can, apparently <br>
but it feels insane <br>

the new Dune movie was pretty good<br>
why the fuck have they ruined all the comic books?<br>
Ironman was good <br>
why are these shitty movies making billions of dollars? <br>
I wonder what they are worth for tax purposes<br>

people are starving <br>
inflation is inflating <br>
and I can’t afford a house<br>
I feel like some of these systems need to be fixed <br>

that guy on the radio is talking about abortion<br>
and some law from 1866<br>
what the fuck is wrong with people? <br>
things were way way worse back then<br>

that Hallelujah song makes more sense the older I get <br>
he was a Canadian<br>
I guess he fought in his own way <br>
his words keep fighting after he’s gone <br>
like some super solider <br>
Leonard Cohen was a super soldier
