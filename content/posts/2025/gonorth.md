<div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; max-width: 60%; padding-right: 1em;">

Man digs hole. <br>
Finds precious object. <br>
Takes it home. <br>
Wipes it clean. <br>

Genie appears. <br>

Genie says, *"I will grant you one wish."* <br>
Man says, *"I expected three."* <br>
Genie says, *"Only one - and you will have to work for it."* <br>
Man says, *"Then I want to live forever."* <br>

Compass appears in man's hand. <br>
Folded paper in the other. <br>

Genie says, *"Follow the instructions. Use the compass."*<br>
Vanishes. <br>

Man unfolds paper. <br>
Reads: *"Go North."* <br>

Man walks. <br>
Days pass. <br>
Snow deepens. <br>
Sky turns white. <br>

Man keeps walking. <br>
Reaches North Pole. Stops. <br> 
Looks down. <br>
Folded paper. <br>

Man picks it up. <br>
Unfolds.  <br>
Reads: *"Go North.*"
